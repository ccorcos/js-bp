# JS Boilerplate

This is a basic JavaScript front-end boilerplate so I don't have to spend so much damn time copying configurations from older projects.

# TODO

- static assets
- build dist
- deploy github static site
- multiple entry points
- unit tests
- functional tests
- node dev server proxy
- dead code elimination
- postcss
- css modules
